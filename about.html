                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I am a very ambitious person who have been always starving for positive changes. I was born and raised in Yemen and came to the US in with a hope for a better life. Since I got my first iPhone in, I realized that I like to take pictures of every single thing. Once I got my first camera Canon 7D, a new horizon was opened up for me. </p>
                <p>
                    Being a tech-savvy person who has engaged in all social media platforms helps me to share my photos and experience at these platforms. It also expands my knowledge and allows me to learn from my peers’ experiences. One thing that is very unique about me is that I value all the living organisms, humans and animals. My best friends are my kittens, Lili and Farahat. I adopted them in my last visit to Egypt where I found out that animals are no less important than humans’. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I am a great supporter of animal-friendly organization and I am working on increasing people’s awareness of animals’ rights.
